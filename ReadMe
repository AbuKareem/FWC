if you want to Pull the docker image only, you can Pull it from docker hub via this command: docker pull abukareem/docker-firewall

otherwise please download config.sh and docker-compose.yml, run docker-compose.yml to pull the image and setup the container, and then run config.sh, and follow along the guided setup ðŸ˜‰
